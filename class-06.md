*In this page I will summarize what I have learned in  JavaScripts - class 06.*

## Understanding The Problem Domain

**You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.**

*Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain*

## Object Literals

**Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs**

1. HTML uses attribute names and values. 

2. CSS uses property names and values.

3. In JavaScript:

   - Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean. 
   
   - Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.)
   
   - Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called. 
   
   -Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs(but the names are referred to as keys).
   
   ### Creating an object- Literal Notation:
   
       - esiest and most popuar
   
    ### Accessing an object- And Dot Notation:
    
       - access properties and methods using dot notation

## Document Object Model

### DOM trees have four types of nodes:

1. document nodes

2. element nodes

3. attribute nodes

4. text nodes

***select element nodes by***

-id or cl ass attributes

-  by tag name

- using CSS selector syntax

*Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.*


From an element node

***From an element node*** 

 *access and update its content using properties such as textContent and inner HTML or using DOM manipulation techniques*
