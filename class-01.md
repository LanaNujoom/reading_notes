### How the Web Works ?

1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books. 
3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
