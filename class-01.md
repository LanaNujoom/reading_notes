# HTML

### How the Web Works ?

1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books. 
3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

## Structure :

HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

 h1 is used for the main heading 

h2 is used for the sub heading and so on ... h3 , h4....h6

p is used for paragraph




### WHAT ?

HTML pages are text documents.


### HOW ?

-HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
 
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end

- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

-  Attributes require a name and a value.

### Extra Markup:

-  The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
  
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
  
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.


### HTML 5 Layout:

## What ?

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

## How ?

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

### Process & Design :

- It's important to understand who your target audience is.

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

-Design is about communication. 


# Javascript :

## What is a Script ?

A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

## How ? 

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.

-  JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file 
 
 -Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object).
 
 - To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
