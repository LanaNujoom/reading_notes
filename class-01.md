*In this page I will summarize what I have learned in HTML & JavaScripts.*

### How the Web Works ?

1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books. 
3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

## Structure :

HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1> ... h1 is used for the main heading 

h2 is used for the sub heading and so on ... h3 , h4....h6

p is used for paragraph




### WHAT ?

HTML pages are text documents.


### HOW ?

-HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
 
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end

- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

-  Attributes require a name and a value.

### Extra Markup:

-  The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
  
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
  
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.


### HTML 5 Layout:

### What ?

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

### How ?

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
