**src : tells the browser where it can find the image file**

**alt : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.**

### Height & Width of Images:

img element use two other attributes
that specify its size 

*Block elements always appear on a new line.*

*Inline elements sit within a
block level element and do not
start on a new line.

*

*If the <img> element is inside a
block level element, any text or
other inline elements will flow
around the image *
