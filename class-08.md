## Building Blocks

***Block-level elements start on a new line***

ex : h1 , p , ul , li

***Inline elements flow in between surrounding text***

ex : img , b ,i 

### Containing Elements

known as the containing or parent element.

## Multi Column Layouts with Floats

- width - This sets the width of the columns.
  
- float - This positions the columns next to each other.

- margin - This creates a gap between the columns.

## Page Sizes


Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 

### Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout designs do not change size as theuser increases or decreases the size of their browser window.Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.
