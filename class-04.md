*In this page I will summarize what I have learned in HTML & JavaScripts - class 04.*

## Linking to Other Pages on The Same SIte

we do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. We can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

## Email Links

-  Links are created using the a element.

- The a element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.

- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.


# Layouts


## Building Blocks

***Block-level elements start on a new line***

ex : h1 , p , ul , li

***Inline elements flow in between surrounding text***

ex : img , b ,i 

### Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

## Controlling the position of elements

1. position : static

2. position : relative

3. position : absolute

4. position : fixed

## Multi Column Layouts with Floats

- width - This sets the width of the columns.
  
- float - This positions the columns next to each other.

- margin - This creates a gap between the columns.

## Page Sizes


Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 

### Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout designs do not change size as theuser increases or decreases the size of their browser window.Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.

### Liquid Layouts

Liquid layout designs stretch and contractas the user increases or decreases the size of their browser
winow. They tend to use percentages.

## CSS Frameworks

creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.



 
- Using the 960.GS Grid

- Using 960.G



# JavaScripts

## Functions

### Declaring a Function

-  Getting a Single Value Out of a Function

-  Getting Multiple Values Out of a Function

Functions can return more than one value using an array. 

<!-- function getSize (width, height, depth) {
var area = width * height;
}
var volume = width * height * depth;
var sizes= [area , volume];
return sizes;
var areaOne = getSize (3, 2, 3)[0];
var volumeOne = getSize (3, 2, 3)[1]; 
 -->

 ### ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS& FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS

## Pair Programming

***Driver and the Navigator***

- The Driver is the programmer who is typing

- The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

### Why pair program?

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness
