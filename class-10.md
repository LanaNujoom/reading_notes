# Class 10

## Error Handling and Debugging:

**Error handling is a combination of coding and methodology that allows your program to anticipate user and other errors.**

**Debugging , on the other hand, involves finding errors and removing them from your program.** 

### Errors can result from:

1. Including language features or syntax that the scripting engine does not support within the script.

2. Failing to correctly implement the intent of the program.

3. Including components that contain bugs themselves


### Debugging : 

**Syntax errors**

**Logical errors**

Bugs appear at different times:


*At compile time*
*At runtime*

### Logical errors

1. Logical errors that affect program results

2. Logical errors that generate error messages

### The Microsoft Script Debugger

When  running a WSH script, you can launch the debugger if an error occurs by supplying the //D switch; or you can run a script in the context of the debugger by supplying the //X switch
